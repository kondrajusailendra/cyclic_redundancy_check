# cyclic_redundancy_check

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Project
This is a web-based implementation of a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to input a message and a generator polynomial, and then calculates the CRC checksum for the given message.



Features:

Calculation of CRC checksum for a given message and generator polynomial.
User-friendly interface with input fields and a clear display of results.
Supports common generator polynomial configurations.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Markup for structuring the calculator layout and user interface.
CSS: Styling for the calculator's appearance and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Logic to handle user input, perform CRC calculation, and display results.
